## How to contribute a pattern

Add a `pattern.md` to the patterns directory and submit a pull request. 

For now, add the front matter manually.

```
---
title:  "Hello World"
date:   YYYY-MM-DD
categories: pattern
tags: [
        {tag: 'hello' },
        {tag: 'world'}
    ]
image: "path-to-your-image"
example: "https://your-example-pattern.com"

```
