<p>Public fridgesâ€”with health departments often times looking the other wayâ€”have been popping up in New York City and throughout the country. A Freedge steward in Bushwick, states how â€œThis is not charity; this is empowerment. There isnâ€™t a group you have to thank. Itâ€™s something the community can own.â€</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Who is the â€œcommunityâ€ of the community fridge, and is what theyâ€™re stocking inside what they really want? How do you know if the food is old, discarded, and where did it come from?</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Open forum to log-in dates of when food was added, and who the current â€œstewardsâ€ are for maintenance protocols.</p>
