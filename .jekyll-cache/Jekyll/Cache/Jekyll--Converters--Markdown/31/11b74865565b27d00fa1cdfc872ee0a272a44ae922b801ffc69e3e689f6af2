<p>In groups, micro-agressions and other forms of invisible violence happen. They can take many forms: subtly caricaruting a group, imposing one’s authority, breaking boundaries, hurting people’s self-esteem. Often, those micro-agressions will be completely involuntary (or at least uncounsciously done).</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>When ignored, micro-agressions they can foster a very unhealthy environment and drive people to silence and isolation. Conversely, people’s susceptibilities to being called out for bad behavior make real talk about those issues incomfortable. As such, few people do the work of speaking out when they notice such things.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Social cues and conventions can make pointing out micro-agressions acceptable, as well as instantly apologizing for them.
For instance : A skit, played during the first day of a Recurse Center batch, shows a simple interaction: somebody saying something unthoughtful (“This is so easy, even my mother could use it”). Somebody else replies, automatically: “no subtle ageism and sexism!”. The first person says “Sorry!”. And the social interaction carries on. Presented as an example of “this is how people behave here”, it has a powerful effect.</p>
