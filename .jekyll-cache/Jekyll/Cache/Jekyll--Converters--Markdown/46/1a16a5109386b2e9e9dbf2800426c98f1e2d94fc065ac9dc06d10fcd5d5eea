<p>Context: This pattern appears without the involvement of computational technology but I’m referring to it specifically in the context of algorithmic policing. It appears in so-called smart policing technology, and it occurs in representations of police “science” and rebranding the police with ostensibly neutral algorithmic protocols.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>These advancements aim to create more efficient incarceration techniques, increasing fees and fines, and solve the problem of legitimacy—the police remaining a legitimate department with public support.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Supposedly it would create a more egalitarian society, removed from human discrimination. But of course, the software is not without bias, and in this case, will only reinforce the system of power already there</p>
