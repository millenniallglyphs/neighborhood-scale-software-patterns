## Context
Emerging products or platforms that have a non-trivial learning curve, and are built by small teams with limited resources and bandwidth. Combined with a user base of highly-engaged early adopters who feel a strong affinity for the new platform.
## Problem
The creators of the product are often in the worst position to explain it others – they lack beginners mind, and know too much about its inner workings and messy details. Documentation and onboarding experiences are often low on the priority list and go neglected. If they do exist, they’re incomplete, unhelpful, or actively confusing.
## Solution
The creators purposefully write minimal or incomplete documentation. In the absence of “official” instructions on how to use the system, early adopters write blog posts, make tutorial videos, and exchange advice on social media platforms with one another.
