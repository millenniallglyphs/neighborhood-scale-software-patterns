## Context

Public fridges—with health departments often times looking the other way—have been popping up in New York City and throughout the country. A Freedge steward in Bushwick, states how “This is not charity; this is empowerment. There isn’t a group you have to thank. It’s something the community can own.” 

## Problem

Who is the "community" of the community fridge, and is what they're stocking inside what they really want? How do you know if the food is old, discarded, and where did it come from? 

## Solution

Open forum to log-in dates of when food was added, and who the current "stewards" are for maintenance protocols.
