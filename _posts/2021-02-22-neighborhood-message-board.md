## Context 
Small communities, often rural that find themselves at risk of natural dissaters

## Problem
In the face of overstressed emergency services, people need the ability to coordinate and share information.

## Solution
Repsonding to the California wild fires, communities have set up informal fire watch and assistance groups. These often crop up on facebook. People keep tabs on fires, track possible dangerous conditions and organize efforts to help evacuate friends and neighbors.
