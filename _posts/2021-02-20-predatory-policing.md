## Context

Context: This pattern appears without the involvement of computational technology but I’m referring to it specifically in the context of algorithmic policing. It appears in so-called smart policing technology, and it occurs in representations of police “science” and rebranding the police with ostensibly neutral algorithmic protocols.
## Problem

These advancements aim to create more efficient incarceration techniques, increasing fees and fines, and solve the problem of legitimacy—the police remaining a legitimate department with public support.

## Solution

Supposedly it would create a more egalitarian society, removed from human discrimination. But of course, the software is not without bias, and in this case, will only reinforce the system of power already there
