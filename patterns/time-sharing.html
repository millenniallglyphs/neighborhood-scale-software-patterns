<p>Context: There is limited computational power, but many people wish to access these services.</p>

<p>Problem: Many people need to access computing power, but if only one person can use a machine at a time, backlogs develop. Moreover, this makes poor use of the computer, with spikes in use and then long periods of inactivity.</p>

<p>Solution: Set up multiple terminals connected to the same machine so that a plurality of users can access the computational services simultaneously. This could be a traditional mainframe with time sharing terminals, a quantum computer set up for multiple researcher, or some kind of cloud based applicatin that runs server side</p>
